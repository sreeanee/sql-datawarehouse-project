# SQL Data Warehouse

A modern data warehouse built on SQL Server Express using the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to ingest, cleanse, model, and report on sales data.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to design and implement a SQL Architecture data warehouse:

- Bronze Layer: Stores raw CSV extracts as-is from source systems (ERP and CRM).
- Silver Layer: Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data for consistency.
- Gold Layer: Builds a star schema (fact and dimension tables) optimized for analytics and reporting.

The project includes:

- ETL Pipelines: SQL scripts (and optional Python loaders) to move data through each layer.
- Data Modeling: Star schema creation optimized for analytical queries.
- Analytics and Reporting: Sample SQL-based reports and dashboards.
- Documentation: Architecture diagrams, data dictionaries, and design notes.

## Prerequisites

- SQL Server Express (or Developer Edition)
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Git to clone the repository
- Python 3.8+ (if using Python loaders)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sreetha-aneesh/sql-data-warehouse.git
   cd sql-data-warehouse
   ```
2. Prepare data
   - Place your raw CSVs in data/bronze/raw_csvs/.
3. Run Bronze ETL
   - Open etl/bronze_load.sql in SSMS and execute to load staging tables.
4. Run Silver ETL
   - Execute etl/silver_transform.sql to cleanse and populate Silver tables.
5. Run Gold ETL
   - Execute etl/gold_model.sql to build the star schema in Gold.

Optional: If you prefer Python scripts, install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run:
```bash
python src/bronze_loader.py
python src/silver_cleaner.py
python src/gold_builder.py
```

## Analytics and Reporting

- Sample reports and dashboards are located in dashboards/.
- Use provided SQL queries or BI tool files (PowerBI, Tableau) to visualize:
  - Customer behavior
  - Product performance
  - Sales trends
